%Here, you give a brief introduction to your work. What it is (e.g., a Master's thesis in RAMS at NTNU as part of the study program xxx and\ldots), when it was carried out (e.g., during the autumn semester of 2021). If the project has been carried out for a company, you should mention this and also describe the cooperation with the company. You may also describe how the idea to the project was brought up.

%You should also specify the assumed background of the readers of this report (who are you writing for).\\[2cm]

A thesis for the Bachelor in Informatics study program at NTNU, with the goal of demonstrating the usage of microservices for Trondheim Municipality. The thesis was completed during spring 2016.

The client, Trondheim Municipality, is 
as of spring 2016 using multiple monolithic systems. In contrast, Oslo Municipality is actively expanding infrastructures into microservices \citep{osloMicroservices}.
The use of microservices aids in simplifying maintenance, accelerates development of new features and enables ad-hoc repair of software defects without bringing down entire systems. 

The project purported to implement a demonstration of a Content Management System for Trondheim Municipality, using a microservice architecture. A monolithic implementation was ordered from an external company by Trondheim Municipality prior -- the microservice implementation being an exploration into a a potentially more advantageous solution.
